# ESPHome PC Control via Home Assistant

This project contains remote PC power and reset control via HomeAssistant and ESPHome ESP8266/ESP32 boards.

I use this project to power my PC based systems remotely on, off, reset via Home Assistant as alternative to Wake-On-Lan (WOL) which has known limitations and as alternative to genuine bmc/ipmi based solutions.

Based on the work done by [Erriez](https://github.com/Erriez/ESPHomePCPowerControlHomeAssistant) 

## Features

* Control physical PC power button (front panel) connected to the motherboard:
  * Turn PC power on from any power state such as `power-off/suspended/hybernate` (Behavior short press power button).
  * Graceful `shutdown/suspend/hybernate` of the operating system (Behavior short press power button).
  * Force power-off (Behavior long press power-button).
* Read PC power on/off status from motherboard.
* Control physical PC Reset button (front panel) connected to the motherboard:
  * Hard reset PC on from any power state
* Full keyboard and mouse control using a builtin HID through the connected USB on ESP32-S2 or ESP32-S3 boards
* No operating system dependency.
* Power buttons front panel remains full functional.
* Reset buttons front panel remains full functional.
* User authorization via Homeassistant.
* Use with any (micro/mini)-ATX computer motherboard.

## Ideas

* use the ESP32-S2 onboard USB HID to allow remote control of the PC using a virtual keyboard (and mouse)
* connect a combination of other PC device or raspberry pi with a USB HDMI to view screen output

## Differences Wake-On-Lan (WOL) magic packet

[Wake-On-Lan (WOL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake-on-LAN) is intended to turn computer power on remotely via Ethernet by sending a so called `magic packet`. This has several known limitations which are not applicable with this ESP project:

* Wake-On-Lan (WOL) has **no authorization**! The WOL protocol has no functionality to provide a password or allow a specific computer to wake from. Any device on the same LAN can wake a PC by sending a magic packet. The ESP is password protected via Homeassistant.
* Wake-On-Lan (WOL) can only `wake` a PC from suspend or power-off state. There is no shutdown/suspend functionality. 
* To put a Linux machine in `sleep` state, a SSH connection to the remote PC can be made for example by executing `pm-suspend` command (Install via `sudo apt install pm-utils`), reference [Ubuntu pm-action documentation](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/jammy/man8/pm-action.8.html). Disadvantages:
  * Requires SSH login.
  * Requires sudo rights.
* Wake-On-Lan magic packets are ignored when connecting main power the first time to the power supply, even when WOL is activated in the BIOS. The reason is that WOL is disabled on most computers at first power on and requires activation by a running operating system before the PC responds on a magic packet to wake the computer. Reference: [Ubuntu Wake-On-Lan](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WakeOnLan).
* Running Homeassistant [Wake-On-Lan](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/wake_on_lan) in a Docker container cannot forward broadcast magic packets with a bridged network configuration. It requires an external Docker container as bridge to forward magic packages and is beyond the scope of Homeassistant. This is currently not included in Homeassistant documentation.

## Differences BMC / ipmi / KVM 

* the idea is to make an ultra low cost KVM device that allows:
  * remote control
  * keyboard input (and mouse control) 
  * feedback trough HDMI or serial port

* it's getting closer to a ipmi or KVM solution but of course is nowhere near the Aspeed BMC or professional KVM solutions, or even the PIKVM based ones
  * I have a couple of IPMI based servers in a homelab that offer great comfort in installing and controlling 
  * I also have a couple of consumer grade hardware that is lacking these features. WOL works to start the machines, but better control is the goal if this extension
  * I want to keep the cost as low as possible. KVM IPMI or even PiKVM are in another price range.
    * If hdmi output is not a requirement the cost can be < 10 EUR or even below 5 EUR if using existing spare parts
    * Ideally this project is picked up by a low cost maker to produce a PCB Board with optocouplers and such that can easily be retrofitted to most consumer motherboards using an usb header cable
    * recent esp32 boards should become powerful enough to also take care of the hdmi input, but that's beyond a 2 EUR ESP32-S2 board 

## Hardware

The hardware consists of an ESP8266 or ESP32 and two IO pins, mounted on a PCI metal plate (see picture below). In my case I used an ESP8266 NodeMCU board. Theoretically any ESP8266 or ESP32 board can be used for this project.

* One pin controls the power button by generating a long or short press
* A second pin reads the motherboard power status.

## Schematic

My NAS is based on an Intel Core I7 ASRock Z97 ATX motherboard and contains standard 2.5mm 2x5 male headers:

![Schematic](images/Schematic.png)

**ATX header USB 2.0:**

Header `J1` pin 1 constant +5V power on pin 1, even when the PC is power-off and is used to power the NodeMCU. The ESP8266 or ESP32 is powered via an on-board 3V3 regulator.

**ATX header System panel:**

Header `J2` contains the power, reset and GND pins:

* Power button pin 6.
  * Short press: Turn PC on or generate graceful shutdown.
  * Long press: Generate hard power off.
* Reset button pin 7.
  * Used to read power status via the reset button pin:
    * High: power-on
    * Low: power-off
* GND pin 5.

* Pin `D1` is used to read the power status from the reset pin: High is on, Low is off. Resistor `R1` is used to minimize current when the IO pin is accidentally set to output.
* Pin `D2` is used to pull the power button low to generate a short or long press. Transistor `Q1` is used for secure isolation between ESP8266 and motherboard.

Warning: All ATX and ESP pins must be operating at 3V3.

## Wiring

![Wiring](images/Wiring.jpg)

A DIY breakout PCB can be mounted at the system panel header to connect power button `SW1` and reset button `SW2`.

## WiFi stability

There is sufficient space in an ATX computer case to mount the ESP board. However, the computer case is metal shielded, so the WiFi distance to the base station reduces. It is recommended to place the ESP outside the computer case when the WiFi connection is unstable or distance too low. An ESP32 may result in different WiFi connection stability, but overall it depends on the environment.

## Software updates

The ESPHome application firmware can be updated via USB connection (virtual serial port) or WiFi OTA (Over The Air update).

Updating the firmware via WiFi is enabled when configuring `ota` in the .yaml file. This requires a WiFi connection between host computer and ESP. OTA update does not work when the login from ESP to WiFi base station fails due to incorrect WiFi credentials. In this case an update via serial is required or via `ap` fallback as configured in the .yaml file.

## ESPHome

The ESPHome application consists of the two Yaml files. One configuration file and a second `secrets.yaml` to store passwords.

* The button pin timing controlled via Homeassistant scripts was not stable. The power pin control has been moved to the ESP firmware which generates a much more accurate timing.
* Renamed the following names:
  * Rename `switch.pc_power_button` to `switch.pc_power_toggle`.
  * Rename `switch.pc_power_button_long_press` to `switch.pc_hard_power_off`.
  * Rename `switch.pc_power_sense` to `switch.pc_power_state`.

### Update 7 April 2024
